COVID19 Data Analysis Using Python | Coursera Project

**This project is part of the Coursera course on COVID-19 Data Analysis, utilizing Python programming. All course materials belong to Coursera. The content presented in this repository reflects my efforts and responses to course exercises.**

## COURSE OBJECTIVES

The primary objective of this project is to merge two datasets: the COVID-19 dataset from John Hopkins University and a dataset measuring the happiness index of various countries. By merging these datasets, the **goal is to explore potential relationships between the spread of the virus in a country and the subjective well-being of its residents.**
